# vehicle-ml

Part of [vehicle-platform](https://github.com/vehicle-platform), an SDV-style diagnostics, telemetry and rider-assistance platform for motorcycles (first vehicle: Honda CL250).

Offline model **training** (Python): context classification (first model: road type/surface/riding event), the combined anomaly model (early fusion: CAN + vibration + acoustic + thermal + context), rider identity/style/fatigue (Phase 2). Outputs are **exported** in the format appropriate for the target node: TFLite Micro or ESP-DL (for MCUs), ONNX/TFLite (for the Raspi).

**Status:** the offline data layer (session store, session split, windows, features, normalisation and the dataset CLI) is in progress; no model is trained yet.

## Build
